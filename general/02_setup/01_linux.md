# Linux Installation

You will install Linux on your systems

## Goals

* Learn how to install Linux
* Edit configuration files
* **Competencies**:
  * Linux 
  * Configuration files
  * Sysadmin 

## Step 1

Document yourself about Linux. See what it is, how it works.

In particular, read about:

* what's a "distribution" \("distro"\)
* what's a "window manager", a "desktop environment"
* what's GNU

But also everything else you can find.

Then;

## Step 2

Install Linux

For any installation to be considered valid, after the main system, you need the following software:

* A Graphical User Interface \(like Gnome or KDE\)
* Git
* SSH
* Node.JS And NPM
* Vim / or NeoVIM
* Visual Studio Code \(Visual Studio Code\)
* One mainstream browser \(Firefox, Chromium, Chrome, ...\)

Depending on your distro, a certain amount of that software might come for free. For example, in any of the "mainstream" distributions, you get a GUI by default.

For each installation of a significantly different flavor of Linux, you will accrue points

* A mainstream distribution with a graphical installed \(Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, ...\) is 🔑🔑
* Another mainstream distribution is 🔑
* A raw distribution \(Arch, Gentoo, LFS, ...\) is 🔑🔑🔑
* Another raw distribution is 🔑🔑

Additionally:

* installing at least one mainstream and one raw is 🔑🔑🔑 bonus
* any one PC without a working system \(with a graphical interface\) is MINUS 🔑🔑🔑🔑🔑🔑
