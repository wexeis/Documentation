# Project Thinking

1. What do we know and how do we know it? What is the problem? Describe it
2. Do we:
   * Know this? → State what evidence we have, and where to find it
   * Think this? → How can we be sure? Where can we find evidence?
   * Guess this? → Why do we guess this? How can we find out?
3. What have we tested and what have we learned
   * Making a Change: Fill this sentence: "If \(action taken\) → then \(expected change\)
   * Evidence required: What do you need to measure to ensure you made the expected impact?
   * After test: What actually happened?
4. Develop a plan
   1. What do you do? Value proposition
   2. How do you interact? Audience relationships, how do they expect you to talk with them? How do you reach them? Which channels work best?
   3. Who will help you? Who are your partners/suppliers
   4. How do you do it? Key activities: what activities are required? What are the most important activities for your distribution channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, etc
   5. Cost structure
      1. what will it cost?
         * what are the most important costs in your work
         * which key resources/activities are most expensive?
      2. how much will you make?
         * for what value are your audiences willing to pay?
         * what and how do they recently pay? What would they prefer to play?
         * how much does every revenue stream contribute to the overall revenues
