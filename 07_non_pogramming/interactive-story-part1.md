# Interactive Story : Part 1

You will design an interactive story.

Examples of interactive stories

* [https://www.choiceofgames.com/category/our-games/](https://www.choiceofgames.com/category/our-games/)
* [https://chooseyourstory.com/](https://chooseyourstory.com/)

You will _design_ create such a story.

You are _not_ asked to implement it.

## Goals

* learn to design a graph
* learn to write a story
* learn to distribute tasks
* **Competencies**:
  * project management
  * git
  * html
  * css 

## Requirements

* There will be _at least_ 5 branches
* There will be _at least_ two endings \(one of them can be a game over\)
* There will be _at least_ one variable that changes a later outcome \(an item picked up, health points, time...\)
* There will be _at least_ 2 illustrations in the whole game

## Instructions

* fork this repo to your team's page 🔑
* clone it on one of your laptops
* Your team will produce:
  * the graph of the story \(what leads where\) 🔑🔑🔑
  * the texts 🔑🔑🔑
  * the images 🔑🔑🔑
  * an example, with html and css, of one page 🔑🔑🔑
  * a readme.md that explains all of that, and your intention 🔑🔑
* When you're done, push it back 🔑x16

## Bonus

Depending on the quality of the work you may obtain an additional 🔑x1 to 🔑x100 points. You will be - subjectively - noted on:

* quality of the graph \(how clear, how pleasant to read\)
* quality of the story
* quality of the writing
* quality of the variables \(how creative\)
* quality of the images \(produced or sourced\)
* quality of the HTML & CSS code
* quality of the final page \(how it looks\)
