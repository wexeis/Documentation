Dear Future Codi Students

Welcome to Codi's Prairie!

Congratulations on making it.

Prairie is a test period in which Codi tests you, and you test Codi.

We are testing:

1. that you can work hard
2. that you help others and know to request help

You are testing:
1. that you are able to go through the training
2. that you're ok working with the rest of the class

The Prairie lasts from 1 to 2 months and tests your capacity *as a class*. You all succeed, or you all fail.
At the end of it, we decide if we continue together or not.
We will explain in more details what the prairie is and how it works a little later.

One principle matters above all:

> At Codi, you are ALLOWED to fail.  
> However, you are FORBIDDEN from giving up.

As long as you try, you'll be ok. If we see you're not trying, you're out.

Your first and continued test will be how well you read instructions.

Anytime you fail at something because you didn't read the instructions well enough, it will be bad for you. You can, however, ask as many questions as you'd like

So, here is your first task:

You are going to:

1. Create an account on Discord; Discord is a chat application. There are apps for mobile, and desktop. You can also use your browser.
2. Log in to Codi's Discord server by following this link: https://discord.gg/SC85mQ4
3. You can choose whatever nickname you prefer for Discord in general, but you will use your real name in the Codi chat specifically (there's an option to set your nickname per-server)

I want you all there as soon as possible, as we will follow up with instructions on Discord very shortly.
